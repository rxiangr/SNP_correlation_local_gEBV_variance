# SNP_correlation_local_gEBV_variance
corvar.R conducts analysis of ‘corvar’, i.e., SNP correlation with variance of local gEBV. See MANUAL.docx for usage. The test datasets can be downloaded at https://figshare.com/s/9e643b192bc816d75a5e.

This is part of the analyses included in the manuscript: Xiang R, et al. (2021) Genome-wide fine-mapping identifies pleiotropic and functional variants that predict many traits across global cattle populations. Nature Communications, In Press.
